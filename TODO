* Algorithms
** Compute variance of the optimal solution
*** Hessian Approximation
    Using the formula
    \[E^T\partial_s K^{-1}E\]
    This is only valid for special problems
*** Real first order variance
    For the real / correct first order variance, the covariance of the data needs to be taken into account.
    This is done by computing
    \[E^T(\partial_s K^{-1}\partial_p K)V_p(\partial_s K^{-1}\partial_p K)E\]
    where $V_p$ is the covariance matrix of the data $p$

** Compute a 1-D parametric perturbation
   Suppose a $\Delta p$ is given by an AMPL suffix .perturbed
   The fix-relax strategy would work on this.

* Details
** MakeNewFromNumericMetaData
   Should be written as a member for DenseVectorSpace.
   This would for example make the generation of $\Delta p$ from an AMPL suffix very easy.
